Theoretical Background
======================

This section of the documentation contains the theoretical underpinning of the algorithms currently
available as part of **PyZEAL**. A list of original research publications providing significantly more details
can be found in the :ref:`Bibliography <bibliography>` below.

.. important::
   The bibliography provided below is necessarily incomplete. It can only be a starting point for anyone wanting
   to go deeper into the theory of the numerical calculation of divisors of meromorphic functions.
