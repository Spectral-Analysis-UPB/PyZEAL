Introduction to PyZEAL's Documentation
======================================
*PyZEAL* aims to provide facilities for the calculation of zeros and poles of holomorphic and meromorphic functions.

These types of functions exhibit a rich structure, which opens the possibility for moreefficient root-finding algorithms than for arbitrary smooth functions. The goal of this project then is the practical implementation of these root-finding algorithms in an open-source package, as there seems to be a surprising gap in the landscape of existing numerical software tools. 

The approach to this will be iteratively implementing and optimizing a variety of different algorithms and comparing them, while simultaneously exposing an easy-to-use and accessible API.

For more information on the theoretical background of these algorithms, view the :ref:`theoretical_background` page.
