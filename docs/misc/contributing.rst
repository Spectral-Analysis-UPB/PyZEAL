If you would like to contribute anything from an improvement of the documentation, a new feature request, bug
report or (parts of) a root finding algorithm, please feel free to do so.
Any collaborations are welcome and the documentation or the open issues might be a good place to start.

To contribute, either clone or fork the GitHub repository and create a development branch dev/<your_feature>.
Once you have completed your work on this branch create a pull request on the main branch of the repo. At this point
your PR requires (at least) one positive review from a core contributor. Once you have received such a review, maybe
after addressing some comments and suggestions by the reviewer(s), your PR will be merged, effectively making your
work part of the mainline PyZEAL package.
