The Origin of the PyZEAL Project
================================

This is the introduction to the PyZEAL numerics project dealing with the calculation
of zeros of holomorphic functions. In doing so we plan on porting much of the functionality
of the original **ZEAL** (ZEros of AnaLytic functions [KVanBarelR+00]_) Fortran90 package (and namesake for this project)
to Python while adding both convenience features as well as more recent algorithms.

PyZEAL originated as part of the **PyZeta** project which provides facilities for the calculation
of dynamical zeta functions. These in turn allow one to determine dynamical invariants called
*Ruelle resonances* as their zeros (see the image below). Dynamical determinants being examples for rather complicated
holomorphic functions therefore set the context for the independent investigation and implementation
of root finding algorithms for this class of functions in the form of the present project.
