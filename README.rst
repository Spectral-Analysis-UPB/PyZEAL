Introduction
------------

This project implements numerical algorithms for the computation of zeros of holomorphic and the zeros, poles and residues of meromorphic functions.
It aspires to be a successor to and an extension of the original ZEAL (ZEros of AnaLytic functions) package written in Fortran90 by Kravanja, Van Barel, Ragos, Vrahatis, and Zafiropoulos [KVanBarelR+00]_.
The full documentation of this project is hosted on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyzeal.readthedocs.io/en/latest//>`_.

.. [KVanBarelR+00] Kravanja, Van Barel, Ragos, Vrahatis, and Zafiropoulos. ZEAL: A mathematical software package for computing zeros of analytic functions. Computer Physics Communications, 124(2):212â€“232, 2000.

------------
Installation
------------

To install this package you have to clone this repository using ``git clone``.
Then you can simply use ``pip`` to install the package via

.. code:: bash

  $ python3 -m pip install -e .[dev]

locally in editable mode (``-e``) and including all requirements necessary for development (``[dev]``).
The latter are optional and can be skipped if you just want to use **PyZEAL** as a third-party module in your own applications.

Contributing
------------

If you would like to contribute anything from an improvement of the documentation, a new feature request, bug report or (parts of) a root finding algorithm,
please feel free to do so.
Any collaborations are welcome and the documentation or the open issues might be a good place to start.
